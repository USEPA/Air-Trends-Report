## Description

EPA publishes an annual air trends report in the form of an interactive web application (https://gispub.epa.gov/air/trendsreport/2017/). The report features a suite of visualization tools that allow the user to:

* Learn about air pollution and how it can affect our health and environment.
* Compare key air emissions to gross domestic product, vehicle miles traveled, population, and energy consumption back to 1970.
* Take a closer look at how the number of days with unhealthy air has dropped since 2000 in 35 major US cities.
* Explore how air quality and emissions have changed through time and space for each of the common air pollutants.
* Check out air trends where you live.
* Users will also be able to share this content across social media, with access to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and other major social media sites.

This repository contains the code used throughout the 2017 trends report.

The repo has been entered into the EPA's Reusable Component Services (RCS) system at: https://ofmpub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry2/reusereg/searchandretrieve/details/general/9717
