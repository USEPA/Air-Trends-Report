In order to check which icomoon fonts are available and what their content codes are we need to import fonts/icomoon.svg file in icomoon.io/app website to bring in all the fonts and then we can select icon fonts and inspect their codes.

There is an Import Icons button at top of screen. Just need to click generate Font and it will show you codes for each icon font.
You don't need to actually download any fonts.

If it turns you you wanted to add a font, then you would select that font also from another source and then generate and download and replace icomoon font files in font folder.
